# Pulses-for-neuromorphic-applications
A matlab program with additional csv files to create piecewise linear curves to potentiate and read neurons.
The matlab program outputs a time vs. Gate voltage and time vs. Drain voltage in text files 'VG.txt' and 'VD.txt'
VG.txt and VD.txt can be used to potentiate a FeFET/ RRAM and other synaptic devices.
